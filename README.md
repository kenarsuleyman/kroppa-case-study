You can build project using Docker with following command:
```docker-compose up --build```

Postman collection is located in root folder of project.

Note: Due to I/O performance of Docker on Windows with WSL2, it might run slow on Windows. More information can be found at https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues/7719
